### Platformer

This is a simple platforming game I built with Processing in my first programming class. The assignment was to write a program that used arrays; I was so excited about my newly discovered love of coding that I went ahead and built a game, writing object classes and inheritance and my own collision detection system. Two and a half years have passed since then and the code is starting to look a little rough around the edges, but it still plays nicely and I have a certain fondness for it.
